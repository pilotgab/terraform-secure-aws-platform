🚨 SOC Alerting & Detection Strategy

📌 Overview

This document describes the Security Operations Centre (SOC) alerting and detection strategy implemented in the Secure Multi-Account AWS Platform.

The alerting system is built on centralized telemetry collected through AWS Security Lake, enriched with signals from CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and VPC Flow Logs. Alerts are designed to notify security personnel immediately when high-risk or abnormal activity is detected.

The design reflects real-world SOC practices used in regulated and enterprise environments.

🧠 Alerting Philosophy

The alerting strategy follows these principles:
	•	Alerts represent meaningful security risk
	•	Noise and false positives are minimized
	•	Each alert has a clear security intent
	•	Alerts are severity classified
	•	Notifications are automated via Amazon SNS
	•	Every alert has a documented SOC runbook

Dashboards provide visibility. Alerts drive response.

🚨 Implemented Alerts

1️⃣ GuardDuty High / Critical Findings

This alert triggers when AWS GuardDuty detects high-risk or critical security findings. These findings typically indicate malware activity, credential compromise, suspicious API behaviour, or active exploitation attempts.

Severity: Critical

Detection Logic (text representation):
severity.label IN (“HIGH”, “CRITICAL”)

Action:
Send notification to SNS topic soc-alerts-critical

Mapped Runbook:
security-detections/runbooks/guardduty.md

SOC Meaning:
Active high-risk threat detected that requires immediate investigation.

⸻

2️⃣ Root Account Activity (Zero Tolerance)

This alert triggers on any use of the AWS root account. Root credentials bypass IAM controls and their usage is treated as a critical security event.

Severity: Critical

Detection Logic (text representation):
user.identity.type equals Root

Action:
Send notification to SNS topic soc-alerts-critical

Mapped Runbook:
security-detections/runbooks/root-account.md

SOC Meaning:
Potential account compromise or policy violation requiring immediate containment.

⸻

3️⃣ Excessive Rejected VPC Traffic

This alert detects unusually high volumes of rejected VPC traffic. Such behaviour may indicate network scanning, lateral movement attempts, or misconfigured security controls.

Severity: Medium

Detection Logic (text representation):
VPC Flow Log action equals REJECT
Count greater than 100 events within 10 minutes

Action:
Send notification to SNS topic soc-alerts-medium

Mapped Runbook:
security-detections/runbooks/vpc-scanning.md

SOC Meaning:
Suspicious network behaviour that warrants investigation.

⸻

4️⃣ Terraform State Access Outside Approved Roles

Terraform state files often contain sensitive infrastructure metadata and credentials. This alert triggers when Terraform state files are accessed outside approved backend or CI/CD roles.

Severity: High

Detection Logic (text representation):
api.request.object.key contains terraform.tfstate
AND user.identity.arn NOT matching TerraformBackendRole

Action:
Send notification to SNS topic soc-alerts-high

Mapped Runbook:
security-detections/runbooks/terraform-state.md

SOC Meaning:
Potential infrastructure compromise or unauthorized access to sensitive data.

📊 Alert Severity, MITRE Mapping & Routing
| Alert Type                     | Severity  | SNS Topic            | MITRE Technique | Security Impact                     |
|--------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| GuardDuty High / Critical      | Critical  | soc-alerts-critical  | T1204           | Active threat execution             |
| Root Account Activity          | Critical  | soc-alerts-critical  | T1078           | Privileged account abuse            |
| Terraform State Access         | High      | soc-alerts-high      | T1552           | Exposure of sensitive credentials  |
| VPC Scanning / Traffic Anomaly | Medium    | soc-alerts-medium    | T1046           | Network reconnaissance             |

⸻
🔔 Notification & Escalation

Alerts are routed through severity-based SNS topics to ensure appropriate escalation:
	•	Critical alerts require immediate response
	•	High alerts indicate infrastructure integrity risk
	•	Medium alerts represent suspicious activity

SNS subscriptions deliver alerts via email and can be extended to Slack, PagerDuty, or SIEM platforms.

⸻

🔗 OpenSearch Notification Destinations

OpenSearch monitors send alerts via Notification Destinations.
Each destination maps to an SNS topic created via Terraform.

SNS topics are defined as:
	•	soc-alerts-critical
	•	soc-alerts-high
	•	soc-alerts-medium

Each SNS topic is registered once in OpenSearch as a Notification Destination.
Monitor triggers reference the destination_id returned by OpenSearch.

⸻
📘 SOC Runbooks

Each alert is mapped to a SOC runbook located at:
security-detections/runbooks/

Runbooks provide step-by-step guidance for:
	•	Investigation
	•	Validation
	•	Containment
	•	Remediation
	•	Post-incident review

This ensures consistent and repeatable incident response.

⸻

🎯 Why This Matters

This alerting and detection framework demonstrates:
	•	SOC-style cloud security operations
	•	Threat-driven detection design
	•	Practical use of AWS Security Lake
	•	Severity-based escalation
	•	Alignment with MITRE ATT&CK
	•	Operational security maturity

It shows not only how infrastructure is secured, but how security is actively monitored, detected, and responded to.
